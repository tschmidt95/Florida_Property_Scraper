== UI expectations (TEMP DEBUG) ==
- Map page shows a "Draw Debug" overlay (top-right) with: isDrawing, lastEvent, vertexCount, closed, ringCount.
- Polygon finish paths should all work: first-vertex click, double-click, and toolbar Finish.
- "Run (debug)" renders payload + response summary on-screen: records.length, zoning_options.length, future_land_use_options.length, plus sample rows.
- Zoning/FLU filters: clearly usable width, options list opens (Show/Hide), checkboxes clickable, chips removable.
- Parcel Lines overlay shows: "parcel lines loaded: N features" and tooltips use robust owner/address/parcel fallbacks.
